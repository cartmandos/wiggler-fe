/* The Pet Page should display all the pet's details, including its type, name, adoption status, picture, height, weight, color, bio, hypoallergenic, dietary restrictions, and breed. If the user is the owner, a button to return the pet to the adoption center should be available, and if not, the user should see a button to adopt or foster the pet. There should also be an additional button to save the pet for later (or unsave if already saved). */
